# World COVID Data Investigtaion - Tableau Visualization
This was an investigation to determine reasoning behind differing vaccination rates. 

# Results - Part 1
This visualization was the result of trying to identify trends and the reasons behind differing vaccination rates.
The most significant appear to be Income Group and Development Metrics.

In organizing the data in Tableau. Income Group appeared as one of the features when filtering by location, which showed its importance in that it apepared in that part of the data.
The resultant separation of Income Group to see it's relation to vaccination rates, shows that those in higher income groups have higher rates of vaccination.
This brings questions forth such as access to vaccinations and also the perception of vaccination among social classes which could be investigated further.

# Results - Part 2
In order to gain further insight into the causation behind vaccination rates, I considered country development metrics in Europe to see if that was an influencing factor.  I compared rates to life expectancy and human development index.

We can see that while the people vaccinated varies greatly, it does not correspond to the metrics selected.
We can also see that it doesn't directly correlate to population, since Russia with the largest population in Europe, doesn't have the highest vaccination rate.

So here further investigation is required, such as access to vaccination centers, government enforcement of vaccinations, and public perception of vaccinations.
