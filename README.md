# World COVID Data Investigtaion - Tableau Visualization
This visualization was the result of trying to identify trends and the reasons behind differing vaccination rates.
The most significant appear to be Income Group and Development Metrics.  Rates over time was also selected, but didn't provide as significant inisght into the social and economic factors behind differing rates.

# Results - Part 1
When organizing the data in Tableau, "Income Group" appeared as an anamolous metric when filtering by "Location".  This reflect its importance since it appeared in the location data, and merited further visualization.

The resultant separation of Income Group from Location to see its relation to vaccination rates, shows that those in middle income groups have higher rates of vaccination.  Although those at the highest and lowest both are the smallest.
This brings questions forth such as access to and necessity of vaccinations, since perhaps high net worth individual have other sources of income and less need for vaccination to work, and also the perception of vaccination among social classes which could be investigated further.

# Results - Part 2
In order to gain further insight into the causation behind vaccination rates, I considered country development metrics in Europe to see if that was an influencing factor.  I compared rates to life expectancy and human development index.

We can see that while the people vaccinated varies greatly, it does not correspond to the metrics selected.
We can also see that it doesn't directly correlate to population, since Russia with the largest population in Europe, doesn't have the highest vaccination rate.

So here further investigation is required, such as access to vaccination centers, government enforcement of vaccinations, and public perception of vaccinations.
